* V 2.0
  Version 2.0 is an almost complete rewrite of the qr_mumps
  package. Here are some of the main changes wrt previous versions
  - Parallelism is now achieved using the StarPU runtime engine.
  - 2D block partitioning can be used for frontal matrices in
    combination with communication avoiding dense factorization
    algorithms
  - it is possible to bound the memory consumption of the parallel
    factorization phase
  - pipelining of operation can be achieved through the asynchronous
    API
  - the error handling has been deeply modified to make it thread-safe


* V 1.2
  - Added a method to extract the R factor once the factorization is
    computed.

* V 1.1
  - There is no limit to the number of concurrent instances of
    qrm_spmat_c in the C interface
  - A number of minor bugfixes
